Runescape bot written with DreamBot api to train the hunter skill on lizards

Another project I worked on a long time ago with the DreamBot api for my own personal use.
This one turned out to be more complex than others, in part because my familiarity with Java was increasing.
Still has it's problems (I remember the camera swinging wildly around under certain conditions was particularly frustrating),
but it got the job done, and my account didn't get banned, so that's a win!
